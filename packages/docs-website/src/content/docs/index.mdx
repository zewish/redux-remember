## Key Features

- Saves (persists) and loads (rehydrates) only allowed keys and does not touch anything else.
- Completely unit and battle tested.
- Works on both web (any redux compatible app) and native (react-native).

## Storage Support

Works with any of the following:
- **AsyncStorage** (react-native)
- **LocalStorage** (web)
- **SessionStorage** (web)
- **Your own custom storage driver** that implements `setItem(key, value)` and `getItem(key)`
